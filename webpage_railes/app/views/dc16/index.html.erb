Welcome to the Web badge.

<p class="news">This website is exists to allow anyone to turn their Dc16 badge into a web-badge.  To prove it works, this site is hosted by a Dc16 web enabled badge!</p>

<p class="new">To keep the site responsive, the larger content is hosted else where.  Also, the dynamic content is hosted on another server.  The web-badge can only server out static content.  A built in web forum is something I pondered with, but in an effort to get the web-badge public, I decided to not worry about it.</p>
